SYSTEM DOCUMENT 7741-C, revision 9, frozen text — quote from it, never extend it.

Section 1, Invariants. The ledger defines three invariants that every batch
must preserve end to end. First, monotonic sequence: each record carries a
sequence number exactly one greater than its predecessor, and gaps are
treated as corruption, never as reordering. Second, bounded drift: the
clock offset between any two nodes in the batch must stay under forty
milliseconds for the duration of the batch, and an offset beyond that bound
invalidates every record written after the breach. Third, closed membership:
a node joins the batch through a single signed admission record and leaves
through a single signed departure record, and no record may reference a node
outside its admission and departure interval.

Section 2, Batch lifecycle. A batch opens when the coordinator writes the
genesis record, assigning the batch id and the initial sequence window.
Nodes acknowledge the genesis record, after which the coordinator admits
writes. The batch runs until either the coordinator writes the seal record
or the drift invariant is breached. When a batch seals, every node flushes
its local ledger segment to the archive tier and reports the segment digest.
The digest is the hash of the concatenated record envelopes in sequence
order, excluding payloads. Two nodes that sealed the same batch must report
the same digest; a mismatch is escalated as a split-brain event and the
batch is quarantined.

Section 3, Recovery. Recovery replays the archived segments in sequence
order against an empty ledger until the digest matches the sealed value.
Replay is deterministic by construction: the envelope fixes the record
bytes, and the sequence order fixes their application order. Recovery never
consults a live node; a replay that cannot reproduce the sealed digest
marks the segment as untrusted and routes it to manual review. The recovery
window is bounded at ninety minutes per segment, and a segment that exceeds
the window is split at the nearest checkpoint boundary and retried in
halves.

Section 4, Checksum rule. The envelope checksum is computed over the header
fields in their serialized order: batch id, sequence number, node id,
timestamp, then payload length. The checksum excludes the payload itself,
which is carried separately and verified against the declared length only.
When a record is archived, the archive tier recomputes the checksum from the
stored header and refuses any record whose recomputed value differs from
the recorded one; such a record is quarantined with its recomputed value
attached. The checksum is sixteen bytes and is never truncated in transit.

Section 5, Escalation ladder. A drift breach escalates to the coordinator
within one heartbeat interval. A digest mismatch escalates immediately and
pauses admission. A split-brain event escalates to the on-call engineer and
freezes the archive tier until the quarantined batch is resolved. Escalation
records carry the breached invariant by name, the observed values, and the
bounds from this document, in that order.

Section 6, Admission and departure. Admission is a two-phase exchange. The
candidate node first presents a signed intent record naming the batch and its
own node id; the coordinator validates the signature against the roster key
and, if the batch is open, returns an admission record carrying the assigned
sequence window. The candidate becomes a member only after it acknowledges
the admission record. Departure is symmetric: a member submits a departure
intent, the coordinator drains the member's outstanding writes, then issues
the departure record. A node that leaves before its writes are drained is
marked delinquent, and its unacknowledged records are re-assigned to the
coordinator for replay. Membership changes are appended to the batch journal
in order and are themselves covered by the envelope checksum, so a roster
tamper is detected at the next archive recomputation.

Section 7, Archival layout. The archive tier stores segments in fixed-size
blocks aligned on checksum boundaries; a segment smaller than one block is
padded with a terminal envelope carrying a zero payload length. Block
headers repeat the batch id and the first and last sequence numbers of the
contained records, which lets a recovery scan locate a segment by sequence
number alone without reading payloads. The tier keeps two copies of every
block on distinct media and compares them on read; a copy disagreement
triggers a re-fetch from the member that sealed the batch, and if that
member is gone the block is marked degraded and excluded from digest
recomputation until restored. Degraded blocks are reported in the daily
integrity summary with their batch id, block offset, and the media that
disagreed.";
