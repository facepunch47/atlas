//! The scheduler-side half of the cancel-guard invariant.
//!
//! **A control-token hard stop must name its guard.** When the scheduler ends a
//! turn because the model emitted a token it must never emit, that is a SERVER
//! cut. If the site does not set `a.guard_stop`, `derive_finish_reason` skips
//! its guard rung, sees budget remaining, and wires `"stop"` — telling the
//! client the model finished.
//!
//! ★ Why this file exists separately from
//! `api/chat_stream/cancel_guard_tests.rs`: that test scans `cancel_flag`
//! stores under `api/chat_stream/`, and it was **green** while the
//! `<tool_response>` hard stop sat bare — because a scheduler guard never
//! touches `cancel_flag` at all. It sets `finished` directly. Two layers, two
//! tests; neither covers the other's sites.
//!
//! The cost was concrete: the bare hard stop mislabelled a turn, the agentic
//! harness's `was_cut_off()` (which nudges only on `"length"`) stayed silent,
//! and a benchmark run ended at 9 turns instead of 32.
//!
//! # Scope, deliberately narrow
//!
//! This asserts the **hard-stop family** only — the class that shipped broken
//! twice (`<tool_response>` and its MTP twin). It does NOT try to classify every
//! `finished = true` in the scheduler. An earlier draft did, by matching words
//! like "watchdog" in a lookback window, and it flagged nine sites of which most
//! were comment prose or intentional. A structural test that fires on comments
//! is worse than no test, because it trains people to ignore it.
//!
//! Sites outside this family that may or may not want naming are recorded as
//! open questions in the PR, not silently changed.
