//! Throughput-arbitrated MTP runtime gate.
//!
//! Chooses between MTP speculative decode and plain serial decode by
//! comparing DELIVERED throughput (emitted tokens / wall) measured over
//! whole step windows in each mode — never by comparing component step
//! timings. The previous gate compared `verify_wall / decode_wall` against
//! expected accepted tokens; on the 35B MoE that arithmetic disabled MTP
//! (multiplier 2.07–2.23 ≥ effective 1.75–2.0) while an always-on control
//! measured 18% FASTER end-to-end decode (webserver_ok A/B, 2026-07-20:
//! Σ1028s/10-10 always-on vs Σ1846s/9-10 gated). Component walls miss
//! per-token costs outside the timed step and amortization effects, so the
//! arbiter now measures exactly the quantity being optimized.
//!
//! Policy (bandit-style greedy with scheduled exploration — cf. TapOut
//! arXiv:2511.02017, GammaTune-style hysteresis):
//! - Run the currently-faster mode; accumulate (tokens, wall) into a
//!   fixed-size step window; on window close update that mode's tok/s EWMA
//!   and a deviation EWMA.
//! - Switch modes only when the other mode's EWMA is faster by more than a
//!   noise margin (hysteresis) for [`SWITCH_DWELL_WINDOWS`] consecutive
//!   windows — the old gate flipped ENABLED→DISABLED within 6s on
//!   measurement noise (multiplier 1.35→1.78), each flip costing a
//!   draft-head resync.
//! - While in Serial, re-probe MTP after [`reprobe_tokens`] emitted tokens.
//!   While in Mtp, refresh the serial baseline after
//!   [`serial_refresh_tokens`] (one window ≈ ≤0.3% overhead bound).
//! - A depth-regime change (factor [`REMEASURE_DEPTH_FACTOR`]) marks the
//!   OTHER mode's baseline stale and schedules a refresh probe instead of
//!   wiping all state.
//!
//! `ATLAS_MTP_GATE_FORCE=1` (existing) bypasses the gate entirely.
